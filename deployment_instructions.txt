## GoDaddy Website Deployment Instructions

### 1. Log into GoDaddy Account
- Go to https://www.godaddy.com/
- Click "Sign In" and enter your credentials

### 2. Access cPanel or Hosting Dashboard
- Go to "My Products" or "Web Hosting"
- Find your domain and click "Manage" or "cPanel"

### 3. Using File Manager to Upload Files
a. In cPanel, click on "File Manager"
b. Navigate to the public_html folder (this is your website's root directory)
c. If there are any default files you don't need (like index.html), select them and click "Delete"
d. Click "Upload" at the top
e. Use the upload interface to upload all your website files:
   - Upload all HTML files (.html)
   - Create folders for "css", "images", and "Templates" and upload the respective files

### 4. Alternative Method: Using FTP
If you prefer using FTP (which is better for uploading many files at once):

a. In cPanel, find "FTP Accounts" and note your FTP credentials
b. Download an FTP client like FileZilla (https://filezilla-project.org/)
c. Use these connection details:
   - Host: Your domain or FTP host from cPanel
   - Username: Your FTP username 
   - Password: Your FTP password
   - Port: 21 (default)
d. Connect and upload all files from your local site to the public_html folder

### 5. Verify Your Website
- Once uploaded, visit your domain in a web browser
- Check all pages and links to make sure everything works

### 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues
- If you see a 404 error, make sure your main page is named "index.html"
- If images don't load, check their file paths in the HTML
- If you see permission errors, you may need to set file permissions (typically 644 for files and 755 for folders)

### 7. Setting Up Email (Optional)
- In cPanel, you can also set up email accounts for your domain
- Look for "Email Accounts" and follow the instructions to create addresses

### 8. Setting Up HTTPS/SSL (Recommended)
- In cPanel, look for "SSL/TLS" or "Security"
- Most GoDaddy plans include free SSL certificates
- Follow the instructions to install an SSL certificate for your domain
